# Project Instructions

## Opening HTML Files

For most of the HTML files (except `tutor.html`), you can simply click and open them directly in your browser without any additional setup.

## Running `tutor.html`

The `tutor.html` file requires communication with the backend and uses the OpenAI API to generate information. To view and use this page, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, such as Flask, OpenAI API, and other necessary libraries.
   
2. Run the `tutor.py` file in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python tutor.py
